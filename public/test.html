        <p>We are conducting an experiment in the field of affective computing to explore the connection between facial
            expressions and user experience during website navigation. During the experiment, we will capture your
            facial expressions using a camera while you navigate through a website. Please note that the captured data
            will be used solely for the purpose of this experiment and will not be stored.</p>
